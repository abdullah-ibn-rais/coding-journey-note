I am learning basic react now , from this youtube Channel : HuXn Developer or something .

All the topics even the very basic ones when I will learn , I will say it here :
Callback functions 
what are react components 
multiple functions in multiple files as Jsx and then export them all to App.jsx
Jsx Rules 
iterating something inside a function with Array.map()
props in a function
How to use react icons ( I will see it later again )
the useState method for something that is changing
