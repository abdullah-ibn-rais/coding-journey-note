GitHub for Normal Humans ☕

New Repository → "New Folder"
"Just a fancy empty box for your code. Like a fresh Notes app, but for nerds."

Commit → "Save with Receipt"
"Ctrl+S, but you gotta write a note like ‘Fixed the thing (hopefully).’"

Fork → "Copy-Paste Forever"
"Steal someone’s project (legally!) to tweak it without guilt."

GitHub Issues → "Complaint Box"
"Where you yell ‘IT BROKE’ or politely ask for new features."

Pull Request (PR) → "Plz Merge My Stuff"
"Send your changes to the main project and pray no one roasts your code."

Branch → "Parallel Universe"
"Where you experiment wildly without breaking the ‘real’ code."

Clone → "Download But Fancy"
"Git’s way of saying ‘right-click, Save As.’"

Merge → "Combine Without Tears"
"Smoosh two versions together and hope Git doesn’t start a fight."

Remote → "The Cloud (But Scarier)"
"Where your code lives when it’s not hiding on your laptop."

Push → "Upload with Extra Steps"
"Syncing your work to GitHub so teammates stop DM-ing ‘where’s the code??’"

Pull → "Download Everyone Else’s Work"
"Grabbing the latest updates before your code becomes ancient history."

Commit Message → "Apology Note"
"‘Fixed bug’ = ‘I have no idea what I did but it works now.’"

Checkout → "Time Travel Lite"
"Switch between branches or old versions like flipping TV channels."

Rebase → "Rewrite History (But Legal)"
"Pretend your work happened after everyone else’s to avoid merge drama."

Stash → "Code Timeout"
"Hide your half-baked changes to deal with emergencies (or lunch)."

.gitignore → "Secret Keeper"
"A list of files you never want GitHub to see (passwords, cat pics, etc.)."
